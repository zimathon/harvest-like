## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or Yarn
* MongoDB (for backend data storage)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Build the backend:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will compile TypeScript files into JavaScript in the `dist` directory.
4. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:5000` (or as configured in your environment variables).

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate back to the project root directory:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Build the frontend:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a production-ready build of your React application in the `dist` directory.
4. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend development server will typically run on `http://localhost:5173` (or as configured by Vite).

## One-Command Local Startup (All Services)

You can start multiple services with a single command.

* macOS interactive script (recommended):

  ```bash
  ./scripts/quick-start-local.sh
  ```

  Menu options:
  * 1) Start MongoDB version (current)
  * 2) Start with Firestore emulator (testing)
  * 3) Start both (for migration testing)
  * 4) Stop all services
  * 5) Check service status
  * 6) Run Firestore tests only

* Using npm scripts:

  * Start frontend and backend together (ensure MongoDB is running separately):

    ```bash
    # Start MongoDB container (in another terminal)
    cd server && docker-compose up -d mongo && cd ..

    # Then, from project root
    npm run dev:all
    ```

  * Start Firestore emulator + backend + frontend together:

    ```bash
    npm run dev:firestore
    
    # With automatic error monitoring and fixing agent (recommended)
    npm run dev:monitored
    ```

  * Stop all related processes and free ports:

    ```bash
    npm run stop:all
    ```

  * Clear Firestore emulator data (when using dev:firestore):

    ```bash
    # From server directory
    cd server && npm run firestore:clear
    
    # Or from project root with confirmation prompt
    ./scripts/clear-firestore-data.sh
    ```

Service URLs:
* Frontend: <http://localhost:5173>
* Backend (MongoDB mode): <http://localhost:5001>
* Firestore Emulator UI (when using dev:firestore): <http://localhost:4000>

## Creating an Admin User

To create a new admin user, run the following command from the `server` directory:

```bash
npm run create-admin --name <your_name> --email <your_email> --password <your_password>
```

Replace `<your_name>`, `<your_email>`, and `<your_password>` with the desired credentials.

A default admin user has been created with the following credentials:
* **Email**: `admin2@example.com`
* **Password**: `password`
